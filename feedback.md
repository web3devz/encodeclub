- iExec SDK Documentation  
- API Reference  


#### 3. **Overview of Implementation**  
**Brief Description of the Project**:  
OnlyCast is a private, censorship-resistant Farcaster client that allows creators to monetize encrypted content. Consumers can access content securely via temporary rentals facilitated by blockchain payments.


**How iExec Tools Were Integrated**:  
- **DataProtector**: Used to encrypt creators’ private content before storage.  
- **Decentralized Storage SDK**: Content is stored securely on the Bellecour blockchain, ensuring censorship resistance and data integrity.  
- APIs for managing temporary access durations were used to handle consumer permissions.

#### 4. **Challenges Faced**  
**Technical Challenges**:  
- **Issue 1**:  
  **Description of the Issue**: Managing temporary access with encrypted content required significant customization as there were no direct examples in the documentation.  
  **Suggestions for Improvement**: Include a tutorial or sample project for implementing temporary content access using iExec tools.  
  **Relevant Files or Links**:  

- **Issue 2**:  
  **Description of the Issue**: Limited error messages during SDK integration made debugging difficult when transactions failed or data encryption didn’t proceed as expected.  
  **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add more descriptive error messages or a debugging guide to assist developers in identifying and fixing issues quickly.  

**Documentation and Resources**:  
- **Issue 1**:  
  **Description of the Issue**: The documentation lacked real-world examples specific to content monetization workflows.  
  **Suggestions for Improvement**: Expand documentation with detailed use cases like OnlyCast’s model, including sample code snippets.

#### 5. **Additional Feedback**  
**User Experience**:  
- The tools were intuitive once setup was complete, but the onboarding process could be streamlined with a “Quick Start Guide.”  
- The SDK performed well under various workloads, showing scalability potential.  

**General Feedback**:  
- Sandbox or staging environments for testing iExec workflows would be a valuable addition.  
- Improved examples in the SDK GitHub repository would make it easier for developers to adopt iExec tools.
